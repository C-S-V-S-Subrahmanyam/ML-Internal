**Backus-Naur Form (BNF)** is a notation for describing the syntax of languages. YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) is a tool used to generate a parser based on these grammar rules.
A parser typically processes an input according to the grammar rules and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which represents the structure of the parsed input.
Steps Involved:
1.	Convert BNF to YACC format
	- Rewrite the BNF grammar using YACC syntax (tokens, precedence, and rules).
2.	Generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
	- Define a structure for AST nodes in C.
	- Modify the YACC actions to create AST nodes instead of just evaluating expressions.
3.	Use Lex (Flex) for Tokenization
	- Define tokens in a Lex file to work with YACC.
4.	Implement AST Traversal
	- Print the tree in preorder/postorder for verification.
